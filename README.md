# Colour Scheme PaperColor for KDE Konsole

This is an adaption of the [PaperColor
theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) for the
[KDE](https://kde.org) terminal emulator [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org).

Many thanks go to [z2oh](https://github.com/z2oh|z2oh). From his dotfiles
repository the first version of this colour scheme was copied.


## Installation

To add this colour scheme to Konsole, copy the colour scheme file to
`.local/share/konsole/`. Then you will be able to select it in the dialogs.



## Changelog

  * Adaption of Color7 to support a highlighting used by `watson`.
  * Adaptions to two colours to support zsh-autosuggestions.
