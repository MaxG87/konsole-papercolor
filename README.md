# Colour Scheme PaperColor for KDE Konsole

This is an adaption of PaperColor for the KDE terminal Konsole. To enable
Konsole to use it, copy the colour scheme file to `.local/share/konsole/`. Then
you will be able to select it in the dialogs.

Many thanks go to [z2oh](https://github.com/z2oh|z2oh) as from his dotfiles
repository the first version was copied.
